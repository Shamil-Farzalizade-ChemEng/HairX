            <h1>About HairX</h1>
            <p>Founded in 2024, HairX is an innovative clean energy startup based in Baku, Azerbaijan. We specialize in converting human hair waste into high-quality biodiesel through our proprietary pyrolysis process.</p>
            
            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>It all began when our founder noticed the enormous amount of hair waste being generated by salons and barbershops. While researching sustainable solutions, we discovered that human hair contains keratin proteins and lipids that can be converted into biofuel through careful processing.</p>
            
            <h2>Our Technology</h2>
            <p>We've developed a specialized pyrolysis reactor that converts hair waste into biodiesel at optimal temperatures (528±20°C). Our process includes nitrogen gas cleaning at 120°C for 60 minutes to remove adsorbed water, followed by precise heating at 10°C/min to achieve complete conversion.</p>
            
            <h2>Environmental Impact</h2>
            <p>By diverting hair waste from landfills and converting it into clean fuel, we're addressing two critical environmental issues simultaneously. Our biodiesel has been shown to have excellent calorific value and burns cleaner than traditional fossil fuels.</p>
